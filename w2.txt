I believe the development process is a team effort and ideally each team should be transparent and open to exchange opinions in order to achieve better and more efficient solutions and implementation (this is also supported by the Agile manifesto). 

First of all, I would ask the senior member of the team to give a bit more details about their solution and why they think that'd be the right solution. This would also help me verify if I understood their solution correctly and did not miss any important information they might be aware of. If I confirmed that their solution would not work, I would politely explain where I see the issue in that solution, providing details on why I think so and would also ask them to verify this with me. If I had an alternative solution in mind, I would present it too or, if not, I would also encourage the team to participate in the discussion.
